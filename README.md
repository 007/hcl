# HCL

HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is a configuration language built
by HashiCorp. The goal of HCL is to build a structured configuration language
that is both human and machine friendly for use with command-line tools, but
specifically targeted towards DevOps tools, servers, etc.

HCL is heavily inspired by
[libucl](https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl),
nginx configuration, and others similar.
